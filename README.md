# run2-diff-comb-docs

Probably realised following [this](https://isci-3a12.github.io/intro-github-markdown/) tutorial

Note about Latex: in order to have Mathjax display correctly Latex equations, I had to:
- fork a [remote theme](https://github.com/maxgalli/just-the-docs)
- add the lines suggested [here](http://csega.github.io/mypost/2017/03/28/how-to-set-up-mathjax-on-jekyll-and-github-properly.html) to ```includes/head.html```
- change to ```remote_theme: maxgalli/just-the-docs``` in ```_config.yml```
